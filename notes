Follow the above link to install Virtualbox on Fedora. The final step will fail
as UEFI Secureboot is enabled in my laptop. Had to go to boot menu (F10) ->
Advanced (F7) -> Security to disable it.
The below link talks about a method to sign the kernel modules (as shown in the
error log of the Virtualbox setup) without disabling the secure boot. Did not
try it as it seemed complex.
